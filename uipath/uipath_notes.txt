RPA - Robotic Process Automation

Enterprise automation combines RPA with other tools such as AI, process mining, and analytics

Typical order when creating automation
	Discover, Build, Manage, Run, Enagage

Discover: Discover automation opportunities
Build: Build automation quickly, from simple to advance
Manage: Manage, deploy, and optimize automation at enterprise scale
Run: Run automations through robots that work with your applications and data
Engage: Engage people and robots as one team for seamless process collaboration

RPA Developers focus on the build stage
WIll spend more of their time in Studio, Orchestrator, and the Robot

Core components:
	Studio:				Made for building automation processes
	Robot:				Robot is built to run those processes
	Orchestrator:		Web app that acts as a interface between Studio and Robot (Contains packages)
		Provisioning
		Control and license distribution
		Automation storage and distribution
		Running automation jobs in unattended mode
		Monitoring
These components communicate with each other in different phases
	
Published automation projects are a Package
Package + Folder creates a Process

Attended Robots: Someone is triggering the automation
UnAttended Robot: Robots that are used on a server and are not triggered by someone (Work non stop)

Robots have a heartbeat signal that sends a request to Orchestrator waiting for work
Then it will pass the job information to the robot.

StudioX is ment for business users
Studio is ment for RPA developers
Studio Pro is ment for advanced RPA developers

Group membership is important (Defining a user in cloud uipath)
Four options are:
	Everyone
	Automation Users
	Administrators
	Automation Developers
	
UIPath Assistant is the interface between the human user and the attended robot
Studio license will grant access to the Assistant and StudioX

(Build your first Process)
Processes start within the Main.xaml file

We have two goals with this process:
	Download the excel file from outlook email
	Input the cell values into a web form and submit for each field
	
Sequences are considered to be called "Workflows"
Each of the goals will be their own "Workflows"

Best to add annotations to each of the sequences to give a description ** (Best Practice)
	Right click the sequence, click annotation

Activities are the components that the robot uses to interact with the machine
When reading a range, use a pair of empty "" to read the entire file

You can use either classic or modern activities for UI interaction
