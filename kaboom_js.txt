This is the default way of init the context, but you can pass arg options into it

Game Object is the base unit of an entity within Kaboom
Everything is a gameobject from the avatar to text

Each cell is 32x32 with a 1px border around them

// Get a sprite from a sprite sheet
loadSprite("test", "sprites/colored_tilemap.png", {
	sliceX: 16, // How many sprites vertically
	sliceY: 10, // How many sprites horizontally
})

Sprites are accessed by index, so you can do:
const player = add([
	// List of components, each offers a set of functionalities
	sprite("test", {
		frame: 0
	}),
])

To get the specific frame from the sprite
Or you can manually set the sprite by doing
player.frame = x // Where x is the index in the tilemap
