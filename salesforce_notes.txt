** Lightning Web Components

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

** Flows
Automation can be either interactive or behind the scene

Interactive --
Screen Flows					Create interactions with clients
Autolaunched Flows				Create automations that run when buttons are clicked
Approval Processes				Series of steps with assigned appprovers
Lightning Components			HTML and JavaScript to build interactive components to embed
Visualforce Pages				HTML and Apex code

Behind the Scenes --			
Record-Triggered Flows			Create automation that runs when a record is created/edited/deleted
Schedule-Triggered Flows		Create automations that runs at a time and frequency
Platform Event-Triggered Flows	Create automations that run when a platform event message is received
Apex							Apex code to write reusable blocks of automation

Flow buzzwords
Salesforce Flow		Blanket term for everthing in Salesforce that allows you to create/manage/run automation with clicks not code
Flow				Automation configuration saved in Salesforce with the structure of a flowchart
Flow Builder		Primary tool for creating flows
Flownatic			Someone who likes creating flows

Canvas is the working area where you place nodes
Flow manager, lists of things you used within the flow
Declarative just means that it doesnâ€™t require software programming skills. Flow Builder is a declarative tool.

* Look for declarative options before looking for coding solutions first

Screen flow
Contains a toolbox that contains all the nodes
Canvas which is the working area to add the nodes
Button bar that provides information about the flow

Default is autolayout out and contains extra features compared to free-form

Flow contains three nodes: 
Elements		Nodes that make things happen on the canvas
	Interaction		Interacts with users
	Data			Interacts with data
	Logic			INteracts with the flow itself
	

Connectors		Defines the path the flow takes
Resoruces		Does not appear on the canvas, but are referenced by flow elements

* Best to plan the business process before you try to automate it. As it allows you to idenify potential problems

bools are defined using {!GlobalConstant.True} or {!GlobalConstant.False}
If you use true/false, flow will think it's a string

API name is the name of the variable
!! Add a decription to give context to the variable
collection == array (Ordered List)

No defined date format used in salesforce - DTO

Formula allows you to format and use logic on your data
Template allows you to structure a larger block of text
